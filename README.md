> ⚠️ WARNING: This package has not been thoroughly tested yet, please report any bugs you run into. I will work on adding tests in the future but the version you are currently looking at with this warning was made in constrained time to use in a project

## Why should I use this?

You don't need to, [Hackney](https://github.com/gleam-lang/hackney) is probably enough for whatever you are doing but if you need a bit more configuration options or an axios-like interface, this is for you.

> NOTE: part of the hackney bindings were taken from the official Gleam hackney bindings and modified

## Quick start

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```

## Installation

If available on Hex this package can be added to your Gleam project:

```sh
gleam add facquest
```

and its documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/facquest>.
